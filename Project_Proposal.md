Topic:
Our group’s primary focus will be analyzing baseball statistics to uncover trends and patterns within the sport. We aim to answer the following research questions:
•	How was the data collected?
o	How did this change over time?
o	What statistics were measured over time? Have important statistics changed?
o	Has it changed how people consume the sport?
	Sports gambling has become a huge focus
	Hyper-analyzing, etc. 
•	What meaning is the data collected now? What impact does it have?	
Our approach will involve collecting and analyzing data on player performance, team statistics, and game outcomes from reliable sources.

Timeline:
9/22: Designed Initial Project & Semester Planning Proposal 5% file.
9/30: Scraped data. Having data scraped off the internet is required to be able to continue this project any further. Data is required to be able to make a data set which we will then manipulate / experiment even further down the line.
10/7: Dataset completion. Have the data organized enough to a usable state. Need it to be completed so we can document why we made each decision that led to our dataset completion.
10/10: Dataset due / documentation. Due date for dataset and documentation to receive points and to make sure we are on the right path for the future experimentation and manipulation.
10/14: Start dataset manipulation. Want to start this as early as we can to have ample time to manipulate and experiment with our dataset to update and fix it if needed.
10/30: Finish dataset experimentation. Finish a few days early to have some time to group our thoughts and commit and finishing touches to our dataset and the associated experimentation.
11/14:   Data experimentation due.  Turn it in by this day for points and make sure we are on time with the project.
12/10: Make presentation / Begin essay. The last big hurdle. Prepare the data and associated information in a presentable form as well as a literary form. 
12/16: Hard deadline for dataset, essay, purpose, and division of labor to be submitted. The last day everything is due as the semester ends and is thus a hard cutoff.
