# Data Demo

## Introduction
Our group is focused on exploring the cultural significance and historical narratives of several professional leagues through historical newspapers. The research question guiding our project is: "How did media coverage shape the cultural and social perception of professional baseball during its active years?"

The dataset we created comprises archival newspaper articles from the Chronicling America collection. This dataset includes the publication name, league, publication date, and direct URL to the articles. Each entry provides a glimpse into how the league was portrayed at different points in time. The dataset was manually curated by reviewing entries from the Chronicling America database.

## Dataset Demonstration

### Key Fields

- Newspaper: Indicates the source of the article.
- League: Identifies the sports league discussed
- Date: The publication date, allowing chronological analysis.
- URL: A direct link to the article for verification and further study.

### Creation Process

- Searching Chronicling America for "professional_league"
- Filtering for relevant articles by publication date and content.
- Extracting the metadata for each entry, including date and source.
- Organizing the information into a structured table.

### Challenges faced

- Ensuring all entries were relevant to the chosen league
- Manual verification of URLs and publication details, which was time-consuming
- Had to work through thousands of pages of data


## Experimentation Results
- Going over the notebook

## Refelction and Future Direction
This project illuminated the critical role of historical newspapers in shaping and preserving the legacy of several professional leagues. The process enhanced our understanding of how media reflected and influenced societal attitudes.

### Learnings

- Valuable insights into regional and temporal dynamics of media coverage.
- Computational methods can enrich historical research.
- Filtering issues and examples (American Association) which only existed for 10 years but  had thousands of pages
- We can continue to develop the dataset by adding more archives and sources. We can also study more leagues
- Overall, we learned that it is not an easy process but we were able to overcome obstacles and get it done


### Limitations

- The dataset's reliance on Chronicling America excludes articles from other archives, limiting comprehensiveness.
- Some URLs were inconsistent or broken, posing challenges for verification.
- Some names were mentioned in newspapers not referring to the actual league

### Future Directions

- Expand the dataset by incorporating other archives and sources.
- Conduct deeper text analysis to explore themes and narratives in the articles.
- Collaborate with historians to contextualize the findings within broader historical frameworks.
- Predict popularity of leagues within media based on current trends
- We could analyze the geographical location in newspaper data.
- We could perform sentiment analysis (and many other types of analysis on the text in the newspaper if we spent the time
- We could also perform statistical analysis on the baseball statistics data
