## Instructor Feedback on Initial IS310 Project Proposal

Overall, your group has put together a very strong initial project proposal that demonstrates a clear understanding of the project requirements and a thoughtful approach to the research questions. I appreciate the clear focus on analyzing baseball statistics to uncover trends and patterns within the sport, as well as the focus on exploring the impact of sports gambling and hyper-analyzing on how these statistics are created and consumed. I particularly appreciated the final question about the meaning of the data collected now and the impact it has, as this will provide a strong framework for your research and analysis.

I also really liked your very clear guidelines for project management, as well as the division of labor and the timeline. It's great to see that you have assigned multiple people to each task and that you have a clear plan for how to manage the project if someone feels overwhelmed. This will help ensure that the project stays on track and that everyone is contributing equally. I see that you're using the GitHub Project Board and that your repository is generally well-organized, so would encourage you to continue using these tools to help manage your project.

Here are a few specific suggestions to consider as you move forward with your project:

- **Research Questions:** Your research questions are clear and focused, but you might want to consider adding a bit more detail about how you plan to answer these questions. For example, what specific data sources will you use to collect the data on player performance, team statistics, and game outcomes? How do you plan to analyze this data to uncover trends and patterns? Providing a bit more detail on your research methodology could help strengthen your plan. Particularly, you might consider what data you can get from which sources and how you will combine them to answer your research questions.
  
- **Verifying Data:** You've listed some good sources for data, but it's a bit unclear how you plan to verify the accuracy and reliability of this data. Given that you're working with existing compiled sports statistics, which can sometimes be prone to errors or inconsistencies, it would be important to have a plan for how you will ensure the quality of the data you're using. This could involve cross-referencing data from multiple sources, checking for outliers or inconsistencies, or trying to find recordings of original games to verify the data.

- **Legality of Data Scraping:** We haven't discussed the legality of web scraping in class yet, but I do know that Baseball Reference prohibits web scraping in their terms of service (you can read their terms here [https://www.sports-reference.com/data_use.html](https://www.sports-reference.com/data_use.html)). You may want to consider how you will collect data from these sources in a way that respects their terms of service and any legal restrictions on data collection. You could still use this site for manual data collection, but you may need to find other sources for automated data scraping. It does seem like Baseball Savant has an API that you could use for data collection, so that might be a good alternative.

Overall, I think you have a very strong start to your project proposal, and I'm excited to see how you develop your research and analysis over the course of the semester. Keep up the good work, and let me know if you have any questions or need further guidance as you move forward with your project!
