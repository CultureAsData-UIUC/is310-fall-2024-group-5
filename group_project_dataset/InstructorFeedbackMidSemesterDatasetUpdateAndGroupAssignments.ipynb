    "# Instructor Feedback for Mid-Semester Dataset Update and Group Assignments to Date for Group 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Please find below three sections of feedback regarding your mid-semester dataset update and group assignments. Overall, I'm glad to see progress on the project and it seems like you are working together, which is great. I also think your choice of topic remains a rich one and I'm excited to see how you're working together to realize your proposed project. However, I have some questions about the division of labor, as well as the overall scope and documentation of your project. As a reminder, your goal is to try and create something like the datasets we have been exploring on the *Responsible Datasets in Context Project*. While I do not expect what you to produce to be as polished as what is available on the website, considering there are four of you in the group, I am hoping you can clarify some of your current choices and provide more detail on how you are envisioning your final project and achieve the stated project goals and requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of returning feedback to the instructor, you have two options: create a new GitHub issue responding to my questions and tag me in the issue, or complete the Google form, available via Canvas, where you can update your project plan and respond to my questions or offer suggested corrections to the stated assessments. You are also welcome to use the form to provide feedback that will not be shared with the rest of your group if you think that would be helpful or want to share something with me privately."

    "Overall, your group seems to be working well together, though I notice some patterns below that I have questions about. I was glad to see that your GitHub repository has a `gitignore` file. However, I would recommend though that you update your `README.md` to describe the overall project and the structure of your repository. I also would recommend you update the repository description to be accurate for your project and add a license for the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will say that while I respect and understand your current approach to dividing labor, it does make it somewhat difficult for me to assess since it seems like primarily some group members have been doing the coding and issue management (at least based on the data you will see below), whereas others are doing more of the research and data entry intensive labor. If you could please just briefly confirm that the division of labor is relatively equitable on the Google form on Canvas, then I'm happy to share the grades between all members of the group. But I would like to get that confirmation since it is not clear to me from the data, I have available.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following graphs, you will see some of how your group has been working together from what I can tell via GitHub. I do not think this data represents all of your group's work or activities, so I would encourage you to both think about how to document work in more detail and also to contact the instructors if you feel this data is not representative of your group's work and would like other aspects to be included in your assessment."

    "- For Part 1, I thought you did a great job with your detailed comparison of the 1955 and 2024 baseball datasets, and specifically how new technologies have transformed the way data is collected and represented in baseball. I appreciated how you noted that the 1955 dataset focused on traditional, team-centric statistics, offering a snapshot of performance that aligns with the era’s priorities. In contrast, your description of the 2024 dataset, enriched with Statcast-enabled advanced metrics like exit velocity and pitch spin rate, effectively showcased the shift to player-centric analysis and the growing focus on granular data. This distinction underscored the changing power dynamics and the evolution of data emphasis over time, which you communicated clearly. Well done on drawing attention to how these datasets reflect broader cultural trends within the sport!\n",
    "- For Part 2, I thought you did a great job as well and was especially impressed with the diversity of tools used, such as ChatGPT, Meta, and Gemini, and how you evaluated their capabilities in analyzing the datasets. I thought your focus on the limitations was very strong, especially how though these AI tools effectively listed statistics, they lacked deeper contextual analysis or acknowledgment of data gaps in the 1955 dataset. \n",

I thought your documentation was very detailed and appreciated that you included information about the data types in the `Dataset Structure` section. I thought your decision to do a `Like Player` column for the subjective element of the dataset is an interesting approach, and I appreciated that you detailed your rationale, as well as some the limitations of your approach to encoding subjectivity into the dataset.\n",

    "Overall, it seems like the data is well formatted, which makes sense since it seems like you just downloaded it from Baseballsavant? I'm curious why you didn't just use a package like `pybaseball` [https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) to see if there were other datasets you might want to capture.

In particular, I'm wondering how these player statistics data get at your interest in how baseball has been consumed, hyper-analyzed, and how it has impacted sports gambling. I'm also concerned that you aren't really verifying this statscast data at all. I realize it might be difficult but otherwise all you've done is download a dataset and do some basic analyses on it, so not sure how that meets the requirements of the project. I do think there's several ways you could approach your stated interests, so happy to set up a meeting to discuss if you would like. You might also consider digging into some of the available scholarship, for example there's a Digital Humanities scholar, Katherine Walden, at Notre Dame who specializes in the history of baseball and digital humanities, so you might look at some of her work to see if it helps you clarify your project."

Specifically, it’s important to articulate what cultural phenomena you are trying to capture through your data and how this data helps illuminate that phenomenon. I encourage you to think more deeply about what you aim to reveal through your data and whether the data you’ve gathered is suitable for that purpose. Simply downloading data and using it without modification is not sufficient; you should have a strategy for verifying its accuracy and ensuring that it aligns with your project goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my main concerns is that your approach feels more like a data science exercise focused on statistical analysis. While analysis is important, the primary aim of this course is to create and curate data that helps us explore and understand cultural phenomena. Your focus should be on the data itself, its relevance, and its context, rather than just the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your case, this might involve considering how to validate your Statcast data and how you plan to augment it, both of which are necessary when using existing data. Alternatively, it might be helpful to revisit your initial motivations. It’s clear that your group is interested in the significance of statistics in baseball, which is an excellent starting point. The question then becomes: how do these statistics wield such influence within baseball culture? Part of this exploration could include how these statistics shape the economics of the sport or affect our understanding, consumption, and participation in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture these broader cultural dynamics, consider gathering additional data that reflects this impact. This could include social media data, economic data related to baseball (e.g., betting trends or ticket sales), or even fan engagement statistics. This shift in focus will help ensure that your project aligns with the goals of the course and fosters a deeper understanding of the intersection between data and cultural phenomena."

    "### Progress from Initial Proposal Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial proposal, I had asked you to address the following questions in your project (paraphrased):\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ]  What specific data sources will you use to collect the data on player performance, team statistics, and game outcomes? How do you plan to analyze this data to uncover trends and patterns? What patterns are meaningful to your topic?\n",
    "- [ ] Given that you're working with existing compiled sports statistics, which can sometimes be prone to errors or inconsistencies, how will you ensure the quality of the data you're using? What steps will you take to verify the accuracy of the data?\n",
    "- [ ] How will you get around any legal restrictions on data collection? Are there resources like APIs you could use?\n",
    "- [ ] How will you equitably distribute tasks among the group? What happens if collecting and curating the data takes longer than anticipated? How will that impact the other roles? \n",
    "\n",
    "My current assessment is that you have completed some of these tasks (for example, accessing the baseball data) but there are some that remain to confront, as well as many new questions for you to address. In particular, I think you need to do some more work on refining what and how you collect this data. While I think you have a good foundation so far, I'm worried that you are not capturing the full scope of the project and that you might be missing some of the larger cultural dynamics that would shape this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think rather than only trying to find correlations between players statistics, you might consider additional data sources that could help you to understand how these statistics are shaping the sport and its consumption. I realize we are already well along in the semester so starting new data collection might feel daunting, but I think if all members contribute that it is doable. Furthermore, I am happy to consult with you or help you brainstorm what might be doable in the remaining weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I think you could incorporate more of your previous work into your dataset documentation, but also need to consider the division of labor. Increasingly, it seems like only a few members are contributing to the project, so I would like you to collectively consider how can you right this imbalance and make sure that all members are contributing to the project. That might look like some members doing a bit more in the next few weeks, but I leave it up to you all to decide how to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do think you are on the right track with your project, but I think addressing some of the concerns I have outlined above will help ensure you are on target to meet the project goals and requirements. I also think bringing in some of our course readings, as well as additional scholarship, will also help flush out and situate your project. I would encourage you to reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns about my feedback or how to proceed with the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Grade\n",
    "\n",
    "Your grade for this assignment is currently a B+. If you can show additional data collection that is relevant to your project **or** verify the data you have collected, then I would be happy to bump you up to an A-. Since only Yosef, Nick, and Ethan are listed as contributing to the update, and I don't see anything in the git history, they will currently be receiving the grade. For Jason, Sam, and Kohta, you are welcome to articulate how you contributed if you would like to receive a grade for this assignment. Otherwise, the only other option is for the three of you to plan to contribute more to the project moving forward and get the consent of your fellow group members in which case I would be happy to share the grade among all group members. Again, though if the current documentation is inaccurate, please let me know and I will adjust the grades accordingly. "
