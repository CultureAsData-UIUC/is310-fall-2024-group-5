# Dataset Version 1

## Dataset Focused Proposal
Our groupâ€™s primary focus will be analyzing baseball statistics to uncover trends and patterns within the sport. We aim to answer the following research questions:
    
Has it changed how people consume the sport? Hyper-analyzing?  
Sports gambling has become a huge focus.  
What meaning is the data collected now? What impact does it have?  

### Scope
This dataset is built off of a selection of 14 statistics from players with over 100 Plate appearances.  
This gives a wide but manageable list of players their range of success in each of these statistics.
