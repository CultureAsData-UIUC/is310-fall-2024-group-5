Project Manager Weekly Report

Weekly Checklist

- [x] Created a weekly report for the group project
- [x] Updated the project board
- [x] Checked in with team members
- [x] Assigned tasks for the upcoming week
- [x] Close issue once the weekly tasks are completed

Weekly Summary:
What were the goals for this week for the group project?
- Find a new data source that allows scraping, as baseball-reference was against the terms of service
- Identify tools for web scraping
- Create a more concrete definition of the digital object we're studying

What has been accomplished?
- Identified the Baseball Savant API as a potential data source
- Found an open-source project for scraping baseball websites' data
- Defined our digital object: The record and cultural impact of a baseball game
- Created a sample dataset of player statistics for 2024 (as seen in player-stats-2024.csv)

Any problems or issues that need resolving?
- The open-source project we found provides resources for scraping baseball-reference, which may not be legal. We need to investigate the legality of this approach.
- We need to ensure that using Baseball Savant is within the terms of service for our project.

Next Week's Goals:
What are the goals for the upcoming week?
- Identify a legal method to obtain historical baseball data
- Begin the web scraping process on Baseball Savant
- Create a format for the scraped data and begin putting it into a database for analysis
- Explore the possibility of creating more comprehensive datasets, similar to the player-stats-2024.csv file

Who is assigned to what tasks?
- Web scraping, formatting, database: Nick, Yosef, Ethan
- Identifying sources, cross-referencing information to ensure accuracy, identifying more sources (other historical leagues?): Jason, Kohta, Sam

Notes/Additional Information:
- We've successfully created a sample dataset (player-stats-2024.csv) that includes various player statistics and a subjective ""Like"" column. This can serve as a template for our future data collection and analysis.
- We need to be cautious about the legal implications of web scraping and ensure we're following the terms of service for any data sources we use.
- The team should consider how to expand on the current dataset, possibly including more historical data or additional metrics that could be relevant to analyzing the cultural impact of baseball games.
- We may want to explore creating data visualizations or analysis tools using the collected data, as demonstrated in the Jupyter notebook (player-stats-2024.csv_steps.ipynb).
- MORE COMMUNICATION! We are dead quiet which each other. Start talking more and responding. A couple of you do not engage in activity or work at all, from what I can see at least. Talk more, communicate, and share ideas. ",2024-10-11 22:01:20+00:00,,,[],[],,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,False
