You should start outlining how you will rotate the role of project manager,

We will tentatively rotate the role of project manager according to the following pattern:
Nick
Ethan
Yosef
Jason
Kohta
Sam

Historical Documents: Focus on the digitization of letters, diaries, and official records.
Film and Photography: Examine how visual media has been digitized and preserved.
Sports Data: Consider how sports-related data and memorabilia have been digitized.

What might be considered a digital object or digital representation for your area of focus? You can have multiple examples, but you should explain why you consider it relating to your area of focus (this can be short though).
Yosef
Examples: 
Digitized game footage, player statistics, sports trading cards, scanned memorabilia (e.g., signed jerseys), and historical sports documents (e.g., game programs).
Explanation: These are digital objects because they represent physical sports artifacts and data that have been transformed into digital formats for preservation, analysis, and fan engagement.

How are digital objects and representations created for your area of focus? What are the processes involved in digitizing these objects? In the African American Periodical Poetry (1900-1928) dataset, we learned about the process of digitizing periodicals and Kahle also mentioned a process called OCR, Optical Character Recognition, for extracting text from digitized print materials. What are some of the digitization processes for your area of focus?
Data Collection: Sports data are collected using sensors, cameras, and manual entry.
Video Digitization: Game footage is digitized from old tapes or captured directly in digital formats.
Metadata Creation: Metadata is added to describe the content, context, and date of the sports data or memorabilia, enabling easy search and retrieval.
Example: MLB.com has a database that involves real-time data collection through advanced tracking systems and the digitization of historical game footage for archival purposes.

Kahle repeatedly made reference to the Library of Alexandria in his article. What are some historical equivalents to digital objects in your area of focus? How do these historical objects compare to their digital counterparts?
Kahle’s references to the Library of Alexandria highlight the importance of preserving knowledge, much like ancient Olympic records and early sports chronicles preserved sports history. While these historical records were limited in accessibility and prone to loss, modern digital counterparts, such as online databases and streaming services, provide widespread, interactive, and enduring access to sports data and media, allowing for a richer and more dynamic engagement with the material.

Relatedly, are there examples of born-digital materials for your area of focus? How do these materials compare to digitized objects? For those unfamiliar, born-digital materials are those that were created digitally and never existed in analog or physical form (think most social media, for example).
Digital sport blogs, digital stat pages like spreadsheets, emails, websites. These objects originally existed online and had no physical existence. Digitized objects are things such as physical texts, newspapers, physical photos, that are converted/preserved into a digital existence in addition to their physical existence.

What is the oldest digital library or archive you can find that relates to your area of focus? How has this resource been maintained and updated over time? You may also 
include examples that are no longer maintained or have been abandoned.
The oldest digital archive related to sports is the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) Olympic Studies Centre, which was established online in the early 2000s to preserve the history and culture of the Olympic Games. This resource has been maintained and updated through continuous digitization of historical documents, photographs, and videos, along with the inclusion of modern Olympic data and analysis. The IOC has also invested in technology to ensure the archive is accessible and preserved for future generations, regularly updating the platform’s functionality and user interface. However, some earlier digital projects, like the now-defunct Sports Library Project, which aimed to digitize old sports magazines and journals, were abandoned due to a lack of funding and support, demonstrating the challenges of maintaining digital archives over time.

Conversely, what is the newest digital library or archive you can find that relates to your 
area of focus? How does this resource compare to older digital libraries or archives?

One of the newest digital libraries for the sport of baseball is Baseball Savant. The database analyzes MLB(Major League Baseball) players’ performance by using Statcast. Statcast was fully integrated into MLB stadiums in 2015. Statcast uses a combination of cameras and radar systems to analyze players. This resource is much different from older digital libraries within sport because it gives stats that were never before. It is referred to as expected. For example the classic statistic from baseball is a players’ batting average, which is hits divided by at-bats. Statcast can analyze how hard and at what launch angle a player hits the baseball. This gives the database the ability to calculate what the expected batting average of xBA of a player is. A large difference between a players’ batting average and expected batting average can indicate if a player has been  lucky or unlucky in their performance. The link shows the leaderboard of the players with the largest difference between their ba and xba, so the players at the top of the list have essentially been the most unlucky.

Are there any examples of your digital object that have gone viral? How did this happen and what impact did it have on the object or the digital library/archive that hosted it?
There are uncountable examples of digital objects that have gone viral in regards to the NBA. Most notably, digital recordings of games and highlights go viral easily through video platforms like Youtube. When a video goes viral, the moment is forever immortalized. For instance, Steph Curry’s fame was cemented through an astonishing performance in the 2014 finals, which were recorded and are available online for all to see, securing his position as the best shooter of all time. The clips of his performance are even being reposted and remixed today, 10 years later. Almost any NBA fan has seen the exact same clips, making them common knowledge among basketball enjoyers. 
This one compilation has over 13 million views.

Can you find any examples of free vs. proprietary digital libraries or archives for your area of focus? How do these resources differ in terms of access?
in the realm of sports, a free digital archive example is the Internet Archive’s Sports Collection, which provides open access to a variety of sports media, including videos, articles, and historical broadcasts. This resource is available to anyone with an internet connection, allowing unrestricted access to a broad audience. On the other hand, proprietary digital libraries like ESPN’s Stats & Information Group provide exclusive access to detailed sports statistics, data analytics, and insider reports, often requiring a subscription or membership. The primary difference in access between these resources lies in the restrictions and costs associated with proprietary archives, which often limit usage to paying customers or those affiliated with specific organizations, while free resources like the Internet Archive are more inclusive and accessible to the public.
