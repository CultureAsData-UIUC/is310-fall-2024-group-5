Question 1:
1955 Dataset: 
• Basic Stats: Focuses on traditional stats like batting average, home runs, and RBIs. 
• Simplified View: Offers a simpler, accessible view of player performance but misses deeper details. 
2024 Dataset: 
• Advanced Stats: Includes modern metrics like xwOBA, hard-hit percentage, and swing rates. 
• Detailed View: Captures more granular data, reflecting the rise of technology and analytics in sports.
Question 2:
1955 Dataset:
Since this data is almost 70 years old, it was, of course, not initially published online. Instead, it was recorded on paper and meticulously preserved. In this specific case, baseball-reference.org sources all of historical MLB data from Pete Palmer and Gary Gillette of “Hidden Game Sports.” Collectively, through their research, they build upon already existing records and publish them. One might be wary to trust just two individuals on this matter, however it is clear that they are reputable and trusted within the community, as many sports organizations, including ESPN, rely on them for their historical baseball database.  These two individuals have devoted their lives to collectively uncovering and preserving historical sports data, including American football, hockey, basketball, and baseball. 
Pete Palmer worked as the official statistician for the American League of the MLB from 1976 to 1987, and for the New England Patriots football team from 1975 to 2016. Gary Gillette created the ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia, the ESPN Pro Football Encyclopedia, and Big League Ballparks: The Complete Illustrated History of Major-League Baseball Parks, all of which are seminal works in the field of sports data. They are both respected in the world of sports data. However, it is unclear exactly how they uncovered, collected, and curated the historical data that is presented in this dataset; one might presume that because of their distinguished pasts, they were able to get access to previously unreleased primary sources on historical baseball statistics. Ideally, we would have a certain answer to this question. Both of these individuals have accomplished many great feats throughout their lives, and their track record leads to the conclusion that this historical data is trustworthy and, most importantly, complete.
Regarding the metadata, remarkably, the data is almost as detailed as most* modern-day records. Specifically, modern-day records contain 17 parameters for each team every game regarding batting, and for 1955, all 17 of these parameters are present and recorded; for pitching, 20 of 20 parameters are present; for fielding, only 15 of 16 are present. Therefore, of 53 parameters that are typically measured in modern scorekeeping, the 1955 dataset contains 52. In this regard, the historical dataset is sufficiently complete.

* As I will discuss in the modern dataset section, in recent years, the MLB has begun using advanced cameras and radar systems to measure a whole new dimension of data. 

2024 Dataset:
Since this data was fully created and curated in the modern world, we have access to much more context regarding its origins. The greatest advancement in MLB record-keeping and statistics curation came with the creation of Statcast, the aforementioned camera and radar systems used at baseball games. Because of its complexity, it has allowed for the measurement of many new parameters regarding each and every play in an MLB game. There are 26 new parameters that have never before been measured, including ball exit velocity, player sprint speed, pitch spin rate, and many more. This fully automated system was created to allow for in-depth analysis of player movement and performance at a level that has never been seen before. There have been many historical attempts to measure these metrics, like pitch speed, in the past, however there has never been a standardized system to accurately measure them until now. 

The source of the 2024 Dataset, baseballsavant.mlb.com, is an official website of the MLB, meaning all of the data comes directly from the source. Baseball Savant offers many creative visualizations and clean representations of data, from typical statistics, like those historically measured, as well as the modern metrics, those collected through Statcast. This extremely advanced data is used by players, teams, and fans; teams use it to analyze how they perform, while fans often use it to try to predict future performances. By hyper-analyzing data, teams can attempt to fine-tune player performance. Statcast data has also opened a door to a new level of sports-betting; when more data is available, it seems easier to make predictions about potential outcomes. This makes it clear that the data was not just curated for the benefit of the MLB teams, but also to cater to a highly invested audience. Overall, there is certainly sufficient context to understand this dataset. 
Question 3:
1955 Dataset: 
Its power structure goes team by team from best to worst in each individual stat category. (W-L record, batting, pitching, wins above avg, and team fielding) The presentation of the dataset in this way shows which team was statistically the best at each individual category. This set of data belongs to the MLB and was taken by hand and preserved and eventually converted to digital. The narrative of the data set is which team was the best and which team was the worst. There is no bias in the data set as it is just recorded stats shown from best to worst by team. It focuses on the best teams while marginalizing the worse teams. Still fits within one page so its not that oppressive 
2024 Dataset:
The 2024 data set is by player instead of team and much more focused on batting statistics compared to the 1955 data set that had other focuses including batting. Doing the rankings by batter instead of team is a different power structure. The new power structure puts much more emphasis on personal statistics than as a team. Doing it this way elevates players into more of a superstar status than elevating a team to superstar status. It centers the focus on the best players while marginalizing those towards the bottom / worst stats in the league for the year.
Question 4:
•	The 1955 dataset likely has more advanced metrics than those used in today's baseball stat tracking applications/datasets. Things like wOBA, xwOBA, Barrel rate, and hard-hit percentages were not tracked/calculated in 1955.
•	Modern datasets include some details on information with pitch types, velocities, and movement, as well as exit velocities and launch angles for batted balls. This data wasn't available in 1955 since technology before wasn't as advanced as ours today.
•	Some advanced defensive tactics like DRS or UZR weren't available in 1955.
•	Player health and Fitness were very limited in 1955 due to attributes like injuries, recovery times, and physical conditioning. These weren't tracked periodically like they are now in 2024.

Question 1: 
Tools
•	Kohta: Gemini
•	Jason- I chose to use Meta because of the simplicity of it. It was very easy to ask the AI questions without having to create an account or pay for any subscriptions. The AI didn’t add much bias to its answers and was overall very helpful.
•	Sam: ChatGPT- I chose to use ChatGPT because it is the most popular AI tool that is being used. It was the first big thing with artificial intelligence, and they continued to expand its capacities making it constantly better.

Question 2: ChatGPT

Question 3:
Question 3 from above: 
ChatGPT was pretty similar to Meta and its outputs did essentially the same thing.
•	Both responses: Indicate a limitation in providing a direct analysis.
•	ChatGPT: Acknowledges the need for more context to fulfill the request.
•	Meta AI: While not explicitly stated, it likely shares a similar limitation due to its nature as a large language model.
Differences:
•	Specificity: ChatGPT specifically mentions the need for more context, while Meta AI's response is more general.
•	Tone: ChatGPT's response might be perceived as more polite or accommodating due to its explicit acknowledgment of the limitation.
Overall:
Both responses demonstrate a common limitation among large language models: the inability to provide in-depth analysis without sufficient context or information. This limitation is inherent to their design and training, as they are primarily focused on generating text based on patterns learned from massive datasets. To provide a more comprehensive analysis, additional details about the specific aspects of the response to be compared would be necessary.

Question 4: Meta
Analyze AI Generated Responses
The AI goes more in depth on the statistics displayed in the dataset when asking about a specific dataset. When asked about the website, the AI just puts all statistics under the umbrella term “Player and Team Statistics.”
There were no acknowledgements of gaps in the data by the AI.
Questions for AI Reflection
•	The AI lists out each and every statistic when asking about the cultural object. There isn’t context of how they got the statistics from 1955.
•	The AI didn’t give out any biases as it really just laid all the statistics and didn't do much describing.
•	I think what is missing is a description of how the statistics are different from today’s statistics, but it is accurate at one point in saying that some statistics were retroactively imputed in the older dataset.
•	The AI doesn’t really reinforce any or critique any narratives in its descriptions.
